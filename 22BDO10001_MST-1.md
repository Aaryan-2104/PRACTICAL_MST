Basic local workflow: Part – 1
Related – Git basic local workflow
Main Task
1. Create a new directory and change it. Answer:- To make a new directory simply use **mkdir command**


2. Use the init command to create a Git repository in that directory. Answer:- Switch to it using cd directory_name. We have done this here as **mkdir wq and moved to it using cd wq**


3. Observe that there is now a .git directory.


4. Create a README file. Answer:- **To create this we simply use command vi Readme.md**


5. Look at the output of the status command; the README you created should appear as an untracked file. Answer:- **Use the git status command to view the contents**


6. Use the add command to add the new file to the staging area. Again, look at the output of the status command. Answer:- **Now, here we have created a file named as vi MST1.txt and add it to the staging area using git status**

7. Now use the commit command to commit the contents of the staging area. Answer:- **Now you can check the files in the staging area**


8. Create a src directory and add a couple of files to it. Answer:- **Now create a directory using mkdir src and then move to it using src**
9. Use the add command, but name the directory, not the individual files. Use the status command. See how both files have been staged. Commit them. **Answer :- Use git add ![Uploading Screenshot 2024-<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-13 at 10 46 52 AM" src="https://github.com/Aaryan-2104/PRACTICAL_MST/assets/89840919/217797a8-92f2-4087-9e38-33edb040030c">

10. Make a change to one of the files. Use the diff command to view the details of the change.
11. Next, add the changed file, and notice how it moves to the staging area in the status output. Also observe that the diff command you did before using add now gives no output. Why not? What do you have to do to see a diff of the things in the staging area? (Hint: review the slides if you can’t remember.)
12. Now without committing, make another change to the same file you changed in step 10. Look at the status output, and the diff output. Notice how you can have both staged and unstaged changes, even when you are talking about a single file. Observe the difference when you use the add command to stage the latest round of changes. Finally, commit them. You should now have started to get a feel for the staging area.
13. Use the log command in order to see all of the commits you made so far.
14. Use the show command to look at an individual commit. How many characters of the commit identifier can you get away with typing at a minimum?
15. Make a couple more commits, at least one of which should add an extra file.
